## Introduction
### AIGC Task
This project focuses on delivering advanced image editing functionalities within the AIGC domain, specifically designed for tasks requiring precision and user-friendly interaction. A key feature of this system is its ability to **dynamically generate intuitive and user-friendly interfaces** tailored to each editing task. This system supports **localized recoloring** along with adjustments to **brightness**, **contrast**, **saturation**, and other essential image properties.
